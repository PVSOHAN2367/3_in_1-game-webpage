Introduction:

This is all about designing the webpage of games that we usually play online  and this is just a frontend of the 3 in one game that contains 
HTML and CSS styles. These games are common that we usually play in our childhood. And I did not create the game completely.

About the Idea of the Game:

Caterpillar Game:

This game involves controlling a caterpillar to eat leaves while avoiding going out of bounds or colliding with itself.
The caterpillar moves around the screen, and when it eats a leaf, its length increases, and the player's score goes up.
The game ends if the caterpillar goes out of bounds or collides with itself.
Implemented using the Python Turtle module for simple graphics and user interaction.

Matchmaker Game:

This game is a memory-matching game where the player needs to match pairs of symbols hidden behind buttons.
The player clicks on buttons to reveal the symbols. If two revealed symbols match, they stay visible; otherwise, they are hidden again.
The game ends when all pairs are matched or when the player decides to quit.
Implemented using Java Swing for creating GUI components and handling user input.

Egg Catcher Game:

This game involves catching falling eggs with a basket controlled by the player.
Eggs fall from the top of the screen, and the player needs to move the basket left and right to catch them.
Each caught egg increases the player's score, while missing an egg reduces the player's lives.
The game ends when the player runs out of lives or when they decide to quit.
Implemented using HTML5 Canvas API for drawing graphics and JavaScript for game logic and user interaction.
The HTML file acts as a container for these games, providing a central location for running and displaying them. Each game is implemented separately and interacts with the user through different methods appropriate for its platform and requirements.
